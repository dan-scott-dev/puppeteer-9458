Before running scripts as below, you may want to change the port that express listens on in server/app.js and you 
may want to change the URL that client/app.js sends the request to (you will have to change it if you change the port in server).

In terminal tab 1:

`cd server && npm i && node app.js`

In terminal tab 2:

`cd client && npm i && node app.js`

running client/app.js, as above, gives ERR_ABORTED error.
